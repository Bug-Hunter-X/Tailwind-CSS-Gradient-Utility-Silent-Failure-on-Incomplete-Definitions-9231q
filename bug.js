```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4">
  This is a div with gradient background
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind's gradient utility classes.  However, if the `to-purple-500` part is removed and not replaced with another color, this will not throw any error, but will not render the expected gradient.  Instead of a gradient, it will just be a solid blue color because Tailwind interprets it as just using the first color in the gradient definition.
